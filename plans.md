## Feature Deep Dives

### 1. Semantic Search Implementation

**Problem**: Current keyword search misses conversations with similar meaning but different words.

**Solution**:
- Use sentence transformers to generate embeddings for conversations
- Store embeddings in IndexedDB for fast similarity search
- Implement hybrid search (keyword + semantic)
- Add natural language query understanding

**Technical Approach**:
```javascript
// Generate embeddings using a transformer model
const embedding = await generateEmbedding(conversationText);

// Store in IndexedDB
await db.embeddings.put({
  conversationId,
  embedding,
  timestamp: Date.now()
});

// Search using cosine similarity
const results = await searchSimilar(queryEmbedding, threshold=0.7);
```

**Timeline**: 6-8 weeks
**Impact**: High - dramatically improves findability

---

### 2. Visual Workflow Builder

**Problem**: Non-technical users can't create complex automation.

**Solution**:
- Drag-and-drop workflow designer
- Pre-built blocks for common actions
- Visual debugging and execution trace
- Template gallery for quick start

**Components**:
- Trigger blocks (time, event, manual)
- Action blocks (search, export, prompt, notification)
- Logic blocks (if/then, loop, delay)
- Integration blocks (external services)

**UI Mockup Concept**:
```
[Trigger: Every Monday 9am]
    ↓
[Action: Search conversations with tag "weekly-review"]
    ↓
[Action: Export to Markdown]
    ↓
[Action: Send to Notion]
    ↓
[Action: Notify via Slack]
```

**Timeline**: 10-12 weeks
**Impact**: Very High - opens automation to all users

---

### 3. Knowledge Graph

**Problem**: Difficult to see connections between different conversations and topics.

**Solution**:
- Extract entities and relationships from conversations
- Build graph database of knowledge
- Visualize connections
- Enable graph-based navigation

**Data Model**:
```javascript
{
  nodes: [
    { id: "react", type: "technology", label: "React" },
    { id: "hooks", type: "concept", label: "React Hooks" },
    { id: "conv-123", type: "conversation", label: "Learning React Hooks" }
  ],
  edges: [
    { from: "hooks", to: "react", type: "partOf" },
    { from: "conv-123", to: "hooks", type: "discusses" }
  ]
}
```

**Visualization**: 
- Force-directed graph for exploration
- Timeline view for temporal relationships
- Hierarchical tree for taxonomy

**Timeline**: 12-16 weeks
**Impact**: High - new way to explore knowledge

---

### 4. Real-time Collaboration

**Problem**: Teams can't work together effectively on prompts and conversations.

**Solution**:
- Operational Transform (OT) for concurrent editing
- Presence indicators (who's viewing what)
- Comment threads on messages
- @mentions and notifications
- Version history with diffs

**Architecture**:
- WebRTC for peer-to-peer sync
- Firebase/Supabase for central coordination
- Conflict resolution strategies
- Offline-first with sync queue

**Timeline**: 16-20 weeks
**Impact**: Very High - enables team use cases

---

### 5. Plugin System

**Problem**: Can't extend functionality without modifying core code.

**Solution**:
- Well-defined plugin API
- Lifecycle hooks for plugins
- Sandboxed execution environment
- Plugin marketplace

**Plugin API**:
```javascript
class MyPlugin {
  constructor() {
    this.name = "My Plugin";
    this.version = "1.0.0";
  }
  
  // Lifecycle hooks
  onInstall() { }
  onEnable() { }
  onDisable() { }
  onUninstall() { }
  
  // Extension points
  onConversationLoad(conversation) { }
  onMessageSent(message) { }
  onExport(format, data) { }
  
  // UI integration
  registerMenuItem(label, callback) { }
  registerKeyboardShortcut(keys, callback) { }
  addSidebarWidget(component) { }
}
```

**Plugin Types**:
- UI extensions (new buttons, panels)
- Data processors (custom export formats)
- Integration plugins (external services)
- Analytics plugins (custom metrics)
- Theme plugins (visual customization)

**Timeline**: 14-18 weeks
**Impact**: Very High - enables community innovation
